  This folder contains code for the pilot investigating if genomic data can predict risk-taking behavior. Data was collected by Michael J. Frank at Brown University.
  
  There are a few data loading scripts for organizing and preparing the data for analysis.
  
  We decided to run simple chi-square tests and t-tests to find general differences in the data. We then set up logistic models and random forests to see if combinations of genes could predict behavior.
  
  The data for this project is nopt currently available as data colelction and analysis is not finalized.
